# sms_spam_dectector

Created a SMS text classification solution (ham vs spam) using the linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. 
Trained with a given DataFile in csv format using TfidfVectorizer. 
Created a Gradio app to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. 
The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as ham or spam.

This is based off code presented in class from Module 20-2-3 for the sms analyzer.

The gradio part of the code is from Module 21-3.
